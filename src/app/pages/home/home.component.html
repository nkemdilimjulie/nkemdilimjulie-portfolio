    <strong class="hello2">Hello</strong><br><br>
   My name is Julie. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and completed a technical training in Python Backend Programming at the Digital Career Institute (DCI), Germany.<br><br>
   I take delight in learning new technologies. This led me to undertake a self-study in JavaScript using React, which I applied to build a frontend web application for my group during our final project at DCI - Product Review: <strong>https://github.com/nkemdilimjulie/Product-Review-code</strong> and TypeScript with Angular which I used to design my Portfolio, which is this current website and with this link: https://github.com/nkemdilimjulie/nkemdilimjulie-portfolio.<br><br>
   What empower me to work effectively in a diverse and agile team are my excellent communication skills in both German and English language, intercultural sensitivity and empathy. For my other skills, you can check on me at LinkedIn: <strong>https://www.linkedin.com/in/nkemdilim-julie-chime-13a755339/</strong> or click on <strong>My Contact</strong> of this present website which is my Portfolio website.<br><br>
   I look forward to be given the opportunity to bring my talent of problem solving into your company.<br><br>
   Thanks a lot for your time.<br><br>
