      Iâ€™m a Computer Science graduate with strong backend skills in Python and Django. Iâ€™ve built and deployed scalable RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, and token-based authentication. I complement this with frontend skills in React, Next.js, Angular, JavaScript and TypeScript.

        <br><br> Passionate about learning and problem-solving, I built full-stack projects hosted on GitHub Pages. Currently, I have a self-motivated project going on which is a social impact platform to support underprivileged children.

        <br><br> <strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python | Django | DRF | PostgreSQL | React | Next.js | Angular | Docker | Git | GitHub | CI/CD| Cloud Services | AWS | JavaScript | TypeScript | HTML |CSS |
