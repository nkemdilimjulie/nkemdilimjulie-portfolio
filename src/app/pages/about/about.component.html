    <strong>Hello,</strong><br><br>
  

My name is Julie.

In my youthful days, I had always imagined how a computer could do all that it did. This motivated me to pursue a degree in Computer Science. I learnt a lot about data handling and computer operations using FORTRAN, Pascal and COBOL languages.

Moreover, I have a passion for teaching. By this I mean, I enjoy bringing a novice into knowledge. This inspired me to establish a Computer Training Center, where I trained individuals on using MS Word and Excel for their office work.

Today, many organizations rely on Python for data management and backend operations. So, I took a delight to learn Python Programming. I am now a Python Backend Developer. I have been able to develop many projects - View Projects.

I have a quick comprehension. During our team’s final project preparation, we needed to present our work as a Frontend. I opted to take that part because I like learning new features. So, I had a self-study on JavaScript with React  tools for two weeks which I used to present our final project. Secondly, I needed to have a website for my Portfolio, in order to have a change of technology stack for my frontend, I decided to learn TypeScript  using Angular web application Framework. Currently, my Portfolio website is built using Angular.
