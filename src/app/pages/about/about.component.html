    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello,</p>
    <p>My name is Julie.</p>
    <p>In my youthful days, I had always imagined how a computer could do all that it did. This motivated me to pursue a degree in Computer Science. I learnt a lot about data handling and computer operations using FORTRAN, Pascal and COBOL languages.</p>
    <p>Moreover, I have a passion for teaching. By this I mean, I enjoy bringing a novice into knowledge. This inspired me to establish a Computer Training Center, where I trained individuals on using MS Word and Excel for their office work.</p>
    <p>Today, many organizations rely on Python for data management and backend operations. Because of this, I took a delight to learn Python Programming. I am now a <strong class="title">Python Backend Developer</strong>. I have been able to develop many projects - View Projects.</p>
    <p>I have a quick comprehension. During our teamâ€™s final project preparation, we needed to present our work as a Frontend. I opted to take that part because I like learning new features. So, I had a self-study on JavaScript with React tools for two weeks which I used to present our final project. Secondly, I needed to have a website for my Portfolio, in order to have a change of technology stack for my frontend, I decided to learn TypeScript using Angular web application Framework. Currently, my Portfolio website is built using Angular.</p>
    <p>I am a <strong class="title">Full Stack Developer</strong> because of the following skills: <br>(1) Python Backend Programming <br>(2) JavaSript/React and TypeScript/Angular Frontend Programming</p>
    <p>I am happy to announce that Federal Employment Agency (Arbeitsamt) rated me as <strong class="
      intelligent">too intelligent</strong> before they could grant me an Education voucher (Bildungsgutschein) for my Further Studies (WeiterBildungs) at Digital Career Institute.</p>
    <p>I am eager to contribute my expertise in data handling, backend operations and frontend designs to the growth of your company.</p>
    <p>Thanks for reading. And I look forward to the opportunity to be part of your team.</p>
    <p><br>Warm Regards,<br><br>Julie</p>
